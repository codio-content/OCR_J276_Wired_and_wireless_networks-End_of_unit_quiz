# Solution

As these addresses are binary numbers they are represented by text strings called **domain names** which are easier for humans to remember. When a user enters one of these into a browser it is **resolved** back into its IP address by a **domain name server**.
Users can use the internet to store data or use software on remote servers and this is referred to as **cloud computing**.
